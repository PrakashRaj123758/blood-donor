# blood-donor
A blood donor is a healthy person who voluntarily gives blood to help patients in need, such as during surgeries, accidents, or for illnesses like anemia. Donated blood saves lives and supports medical treatments. One donation can help up to three people and is a simple, safe, and noble act.
